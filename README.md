# Data_cleaning_sample_project

Here, I have ataken a dataset of a Random customer details list having errors in the data and cleaning them according to the accepted standard formats.
I have used pandas to clean the data. 
In my work you can see that 
. I have read the file in the notebook
. removed the duplicates
. drop the unnecessary tables
. regulate the phone numbers in standard phone number format by using lambda functions 
. remove the null values from the table 
. keep only the contacts which have given a permission to contact them over a call 
. create new columns for the address to make it readable fo5 the user
